## How to Run Applicatiom

To run the application, first retrieve all dependencies through npm install.

`npm install`

 run the command below with the text file that contains the data. It will output parsed information to terminal.

`npm start <text file>`

Also have the option of outputting to a text file

`npm start <input text file> > <output text file>`

To run tests, simply run 

`npm test`
